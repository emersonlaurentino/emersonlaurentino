## 💼 Experience  

### **Senior Software Engineer | VTEX**  
📅 Sep 2019 – Present | 📍 Remote  
At VTEX, I spearheaded the development of **FastStore**, a framework designed to accelerate the creation of e-commerce storefronts. This initiative reduced store creation time by **30%** and improved performance scores from **40** to **90** on Lighthouse, resulting in better customer satisfaction and increased sales.

In addition to **FastStore**, I played a key role in building **WebOps**, a deployment and infrastructure solution that simplifies store hosting and management. This solution allows clients to deploy stores with minimal technical effort, improving operational efficiency and reducing the need for technical expertise in store setup.

Both FastStore and WebOps have been critical in enhancing VTEX’s e-commerce platform, enabling faster store creation, better performance, and simplified store management for our clients.

### **Software Engineer | Audora**  
📅 Aug 2016 – Aug 2019 | 📍 Maceió, AL, Brasil  
At Audora, I was tasked with creating a **microfrontend architecture** using **single-spa** to solve the issue of siloed teams working on different parts of the application without interfering with each other. This system allowed teams to develop independently, using their preferred tech stacks, which significantly improved productivity across the company. As a result, we were able to scale our development efforts and accelerate the release of new features.

I also built a **document editor** for legal professionals using **Draft.js** and React.js. The challenge was that our clients needed a user-friendly way to create legal documents directly in the browser while following strict legal templates. By designing a flexible and intuitive document editor, we enabled clients to generate legal documents with fewer errors and in a fraction of the time it would have taken manually, leading to improved client satisfaction and faster turnaround times for legal services.

Finally, I developed a **custom admin dashboard** that allowed non-technical users to interact with the platform easily. The goal was to provide them with an intuitive interface to manage legal cases, templates, and clients without requiring technical expertise. This dashboard improved the usability of the platform, resulting in a more streamlined experience for both clients and internal teams.
